"Water.cpp" (Table O-2)
	a. The inputs are files "input1_800.txt", "input2.txt", "DemPortion.txt", "config.txt", 
		and a scenario file "scenFac_200.txt". 
	b. The outputs are 
		1. "%.2f.txt", where f denote the value of gamma. This includes the log of the algorithm iterations, CPU time, and information about the effectiveness of scenarios.
		2. "Numbers.txt". Number of scenairos in each primal category, number of effective, ineffective, and undetermined scenarios by the easy-to-check conditions for each gamma.
		3. "Numbers_post.txt". Number of effective and ineffective scenarios after resolving undetermined scenarios.
		4. "Average.txt". The number of times each sceanrio is effective by easy-to-check conditions out of 21 gammas.
